# The old AT grammar (using antlr) allowed descriptors of this form, and when the antlr parser was replaced with a
# hand-written one, this logic was kept. However, it turns out that this causes confusion -- as with the old antlr
# system, such ATs would be parsed but then un-apply-able, whereas they could be applied with the new parser. Thus, it's
# simplest and least confusing to just disallow this lenient syntax (a syntax not really allowed anywhere else) entirely.
