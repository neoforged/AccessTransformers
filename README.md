# Access Transformers
A utility library for parsing and managing Access Transformers - allowing runtime manipulation of the modifier state of class files based on configuration files (access transformer files).

The format specification is in [FML Access Transformer specification](FMLAT.md).

Many thanks to DemonWav for invaluable assistance generating the antlr4 parser and lexer, based on his excellent work in the Minecraft Dev plugin for intellij [here](https://github.com/minecraft-dev/MinecraftDev/tree/7605e46aa8877dcd89c98ab30909bae82b1e8a2b/src/main/grammars)
